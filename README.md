## About this project:

David Kelley Photography is a business to consumer (B2C) site intended for site users to purchase landscape photography directly from the shop owner. This site was created as a project (Milestone 4) for the Code Institute, but I plan to launch it live online after assessment. The site sells photography created by David Kelley (my father) from over 15 years of travel in the US and abroad. I created the site so that my father can turn his hobby into a way to sell his photography and communicate directly with his customers through a personal blog. In this case, I designed the site to fit and showcase the landscape photography; I used a retro 1970s aesthetic on the site to match my dad's preferred style. The proceeds from the photography when the site goes live online will be donated to local charities in Harrisburg, PA. 

The project is developed using Django, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework.
