            <p>
                Early in my career as an internal medicine geriatrics physician, I recognized the importance of reducing stress through outdoor activities both at home and during planned vacations. Over the years I have engaged in  outdoor activities like biking, day hiking, backpacking, kayaking, and playing tennis. I have always enjoyed taking spontaneous photos while on the move to capture the beauty of the moment.  Living in central Pennsylvania gave me ready access to the Appalachian Mountains, the Susquehanna River, numerous rail-to-trail bike routes, the Gettysburg Battlefield, and country roads surrounding fertile Amish farms. I always had a camera and eventually a smartphone handy while on family vacations to National Parks, National Monuments, World Heritage Sites, the Caribbean Islands, Ireland, and favorite states like Arizona, California, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Oregon, Washington, Maine, and Virginia. I tried to capture the raw beauty of the landscape and its natural inhabitants at spontaneous moments without the aid of a tripod or alterations with photographic software. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I hope to share these special moments of enjoyment and inspiration with the greater purpose of giving all profits split equally to the Hospice of Central Pennsylvania and Bethesda Mission for the homeless in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
